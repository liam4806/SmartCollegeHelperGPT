    Question: What is the degree requirement for DA major?
    Answer: The major in Data Analytics (DA) requires a minimum of 46 credits of coursework and an approved summer experience.
    DA 101	Introduction to Data Analytics
    CS 109	Discovering Computer Science
    or CS 111	Discovering Computer Science: Scientific Data and Dynamics
    or CS 112	Discovering Computer Science: Markets, Polls, and Social Networks
    MATH 135	Single Variable Calculus
    or MATH 145	Multi-variable Calculus
    DA 200	Data Analytics Colloquium (once as a sophomore and once as a junior or senior, 2 credits total)
    DA 210/CS 181	Data Systems
    DA/MATH 220	Applied Statistics
    DA 301	Practicum in Data Analytics
    DA 350	Advanced Methods for Data Analytics
    DA 401	Seminar in Data Analytics
    (b)  Second, students must complete a DA summer experience (internship or research project).  This experience must be approved by the Data Analytics Program Committee, and is normally undertaken during the summer before the senior year.
    (c) Third, students must acquire some depth in a domain of Data Analytics.  
    They will then carry this disciplinary knowledge into their summer experience and senior seminar.  Students may satisfy this requirement in one of two ways.  First, they may choose to take the designated set of courses from one of the following departments.

    Question: What is the degree requirement for DA major?
    Answer: 
    Computer Science offers two degrees, a minor, and a concentration.  The two majors both require the computer science core curriculum.  The core courses in Computer Science are:
    Code	Title
    An introductory course
    CS 109	Discovering Computer Science
    or CS 110	Discovering Computer Science: Digital Media and Games
    or CS 111	Discovering Computer Science: Scientific Data and Dynamics
    or CS 112	Discovering Computer Science: Markets, Polls, and Social Networks
    CS 173	Intermediate Computer Science
    CS 181	Data Systems
    CS 234	Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science
    CS 271	Data Structures
    CS 281	Introduction to Computer Systems
    CS 371	Algorithm Design and Analysis
    CS 395	Technical Communication I
    MATH 135	Single Variable Calculus
    Bachelor of Arts Degree
    The minimum requirements for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science are the core courses plus two additional Computer Science courses at the 300 or 400 level (excluding 395/495, 361-362 and 363-364). One of the 300 or 400 level electives must be a Systems course and the other must either be a Theory or Applied elective.
